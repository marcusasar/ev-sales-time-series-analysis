# 📊 EV Sales Time Series Analysis (Global Focus)

This project performs a time series analysis of global electric vehicle (EV) sales using SQL. The goal is to understand growth trends in EV adoption worldwide by analyzing annual sales data from the IEA dataset.


## 🌍 Objective

To analyze global EV sales over time and answer key time series questions such as:
- How have EV sales changed year by year?
- Which years experienced the highest absolute growth?
- Which years experienced the highest percentage growth?
- How have cumulative global sales evolved over time?
- What are the top 3 years for EV market expansion?


## 🛠️ Tools Used


**SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the EV sales data.
- **Excel:** For creating visuals.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


## 🧪 How to Use

1. Create the table using `01_create_table.sql`
2. Insert data from `ev_sales_world.csv` using `02_insert_data.sql`
3. Run the analysis queries in order from the `sql/` folder
4. Review findings in `analysis/ev_sales_growth_insights.md`


## 📈 Summary of Findings

📝 *[Add key takeaways here after completing your analysis.]*  
For example:
- EV sales doubled between 2020 and 2021
- The highest absolute growth occurred in 2021 (+3.5M units)
- Total global sales surpassed 10M in 2022
