ðŸ’¡**Insight:**  
The annual growth rate of global electric vehicle (EV) sales peaked dramatically between **2010 and 2011** at **555.68%**, followed by steady growth with a small rise of **1.11%** from **2018 to 2019**. Growth reached another peak in **2021** before declining in **2023**.

This pattern indicates that EV adoption accelerated rapidly during the early stage, then experienced fluctuations likely due to market maturation and external factors like the trade war between America and China, because these countries are the major manufacturers of EVs.

## 4. EV Sales Peak Years by Units and Growth Rate %

ðŸ“Š ![Monthly Sales Bar Chart](charts/monthly-sales-bars.png)

ðŸ’¡**Insight:**  
No single year led in both metrics. In terms of total units sold, 2023 experienced the largest increase, reflecting a continued expansion of the global EV market. However, 2011 saw the highest percentage growth, at over 550%, which was likely due to the market's early stage of adoption where even small increases in sales volume represented large relative growth.

These spikes can be attributed to several factors:

- 2011: Early adoption phase, with growing public awareness of environmental issues and the introduction of initial government incentives.

- 2024: Mature market growth, driven by broader availability of EV models, improved battery technology, expanded charging infrastructure, and stronger regulatory support globally.
