## 4. Sales and Yearly Change (Absolute and %)

ðŸ’¡**Insight:**  
No single year led in both metrics. In terms of total units sold, 2023 experienced the largest increase, reflecting a continued expansion of the global EV market. However, 2011 saw the highest percentage growth, at over 550%, which was likely due to the market's early stage of adoption where even small increases in sales volume represented large relative growth.

These spikes can be attributed to several factors:

- 2011: Early adoption phase, with growing public awareness of environmental issues and the introduction of initial government incentives.

- 2024: Mature market growth, driven by broader availability of EV models, improved battery technology, expanded charging infrastructure, and stronger regulatory support globally.
